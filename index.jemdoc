== About Me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Ottawa, where I am very fortunate to have [https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~yymao/ Prof. Yongyi Mao] as my PhD advisor. In 2017-18, I was a Master of Applied Science (MASc) student at University of Ottawa. Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering and its Automation from [https://english.ncepu.edu.cn/hdgk/130429.html North China Electric Power University (NCEPU)] in 2017.
Previously, I was a research intern at [https://nrc.canada.ca/en National Research Council Canada (NRC)] in Summer 2019 (full-time) and in Fall 2019 (part-time) where I was mentored by [https://uniweb.uottawa.ca/members/4499/profile?embed=2 Dr. Harry H.Y. Guo].\n


== Research Interests 
My research interests span the areas of machine learning and statistical learning theory. A common thread in my research is in understanding the generalization theory of deep learning  through the lens of information theory. I am also interested in domain adaptation, online learning, reinforcement learning theory and trustworthy machine learning (e.g., privacy, fairness and robustness).
